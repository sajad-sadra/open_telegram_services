Open telegram messanger
========================
⭐️ <a>Thanks **everyone** who has starred the project, it means a lot!</a>

It tested On <i>Ubuntu-19.10</i> but maybe work on all Debian base OS;

What is this?
-------------
Telegram messanger and their API are banned in some country like Iran, China, Russia & etc.
If you had Ubuntu or Debian base OS you can use this script to open them and use for <a href="https://telegram.org/">massaging</a> and write and work with <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots">Telegram bot API</a>.

Installing
----------
```
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajad-sadra/open_telegram_services/master/do.sh' | bash
 ```
Notice
-------
+ Run this script with <b>root</b> privilege (you can use <code>sudo -i</code>).
+ Run this scrpt once because if you run multiple time <code>/etc/hosts</code> file get some addition line.
 
 🥂 <i><b>enjoy it</b></i> 😜
